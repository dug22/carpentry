### Overview

Just like how a skilled carpenter shapes and transforms wood into useful products, Carpentry aims to help Java developers to shape and transform their data into meaningful insights. Carpentry is a Java DataFrame library that supports tasks like loading, exporting, cleaning, transforming, filtering, visualizing, and summarizing data.

### What does Carpentry offer?

* Easily import data from local or remote CSV files.
* Export data to CSV files
* Add and remove columns or rows.
* Easily organize, remove, categorize, filter, search, complete, adjust, and reshape data
* Easily visualize your data with Carpentry's custom SVG chart library.
    - Chart Types: BAR, LINE, PIE, DOUGHNUT, and MAP VISUALIZATIONS
