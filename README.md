It supports tasks like loading, exporting, cleaning, transforming, filtering, and summarizing data.

### What does Carpentry offer?

* Easily import data from local or remote CSV files.
* Export data to CSV, or JSON files.
* Add and remove columns or rows.
* Easily organize, remove, categorize, filter, search, complete, adjust, and reshape data
